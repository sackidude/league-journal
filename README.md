# league-journal

Application to automatically generate documents (markdown documents, for now) for reviewing games in league of legends, built with rust and handlebars.

## Using

Just run the `.exe`-file that you can download at the [releases page](https://github.com/sackidude/league-journal/releases).

The instruction are pretty clear. Put the executable file where you want the notes to be generated. 

If you encounter any issues please report them over at the [issues page](https://github.com/sackidude/league-journal/issues) and I'll try to help.
